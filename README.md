landing page for UAPA's call

# Technologies used:

I've used:

- Next.js: react-based framework that allows using components and server-side rendering
- CSS3: there are 2 files (globals.css and Home.modules.css) which contain the component's styles.
- Typescript: it's easier and more clearer than using JS.
- Vercel deploy: it is synchronised with this github repo.
